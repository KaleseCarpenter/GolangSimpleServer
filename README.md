# GolangSimpleServer


This project is a Simple Server I built with 5 routes to learn more about sending requests and receiving
 responses from the server in Golang.

Languages used:
<br><br>
Golang <br>
HTML <br>
CSS <br>

*Future Plans*
<br>
I will scale this app into a full app with CRUD Functionality attached to a database.
